# Amazon S3

- object based storage
- max storage 5 TB
- if uploading more than 5gb use multi upload
- also has metadata, tags and optional version id
- read after write consistency
- 3,5k writes and 5k puts per second


#### Bucket
- global unique name
- region level
- not start with --xn, end with --s3alias
#### Object
- max size  5tb
- 


## Requester Pays
- Requester pays network and download cost
- use to share large data sets with other accounts
- user must be authorized in aws 

## S3 event notifications
- trigger an action (lambda) on api request to the bucket ( can filter suffic eg: .jpeg). handle on s3
- can also use [[EventBride]] for more targets and filters, handle on event bride => filter event

### Targets
- [[Lambda]]
- [[SNS]] 
- [[SQS]]
- can take more than 1 min to trigger

## S3 Access Logs
- monitor traffic requests to an S3 bucket
- can be used for access and security audits
- understand s3 bill
- log to another s3 bucket

## MFA-protected API Access
- enforce MFA for access to S3 ressources

## MFA delete
- enforce MFA for delete object action
-  must enable versioning
- only root account can setting

## Versioning
- if an object is updated the old version still persists within the bucket
- if an object is deleted the new version will be a delete marker, and the old version will still persist within the bucket

## Commands 
### Pre-Signed URLs
- give a pre signed url, user who have link can access to s3, don't need iam

### S3 Sync
- copies objects between buckets
- does diff
- used last modified to update
- if versioned only copies current version
```bash
aws s3 sync s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-SOURCE s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-TARGET
```

## Storage Tiers
- can transition to infrequent access only after 30 days

### Glacier
- some applications can save data directly into Glacier (e.g. Tape gateway, data sync) , you can also do this manually by using cli
- snowball transfer cannot be directly inserted only transfered from default tier
- low cost but higher retrieval cost and time
- retrieve within 12 hours
#### Glacier Class
1. s3 glacier instant retrieval: milisecond retrieval, storage duration min 90 day
2. s3 glacier flexible retrieval: expedited: 1-5minute, standard (3-5hour), bulk( 5-12h)- free retrive, storage duration min 90 day
3. s3 glacier deep archive: standard (12h), bulk (48h)-free

#### Expedited Retrival
- 1 to 5 minutes of retrival time 

#### Provisoned Retrival Capacity
- guranteed up to 150mbs retrival speed

#### Glacier Deep Archive
- 75% cheeper than Glacier
- higher retriveal feed than glacier
- no expedited retrival
- can retrieve at lower fee using bulk retrieve but this will take 48 hours

### Infrequent Access
- less freq access, but instantly available
- lower than General Purpose
- low per GB Storage price
- retrival fee
- s3 standard IA, onezone IA
- backup

### One Zone / One Zone IA
- single AZ storage 20% less cost
### S3 Intelligent
- auto moving beetween storage to reduce cost base on access

## Livecycle Rules

### Transiton Actions
- move to different storage tier after time
- can transition to infrequent access only after 30 days

### Transfer Limitations for Livecycle Rules

### Expiration Actions
- delete access logs
- delete old versions of files
- delete incomplete multi part uploads
- can apply to paths or full bucket
#### Storage Class Analysis
- analysis standard and standard ia
- help to decide when to move object

## Tranfer Accelerator
- fast transfer over long distances
- uses cloudfront edge locations
- routes via optimized path
- compatible with multi file upload

## Multipart uploads
- transmit object in chunks
- if one chunk fails, only that cuck needs to be retransmitted
- over 100mb should be considered
-  improved throughput

### Security
#### S3 Bucket Policies
- add or deny permissions to objects
- can be attached to users groups or buckets
- can grant access to other aws accounts
- can restrict based on multi conditions for the requests (ip, time, ssl )
- force to encrypt before upload

#### ACL
- can also use ACL to grant another account access
- bucket level, object level


## Encryption

### SEE S3
- Server Side encryption of objects 
- aws manged
- replication by default
- Must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"

### SEE C
- Server Side encryption
- customer managed keys
- must be https, key in header
- objects can not be replicated

### SSE KMS
- Need to specify need key for object in new bucket
- need iam role to decrypt with source key and encrypt with new key
- might get [[KMS]] throttling errors, need to ask for service quotas increase
- can use multi region kms keys 
- Must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AESKMS"

### Client Side Encryption
- Encrypt before upload and decrypt after download using own mechanism

## Replication
- must have versioning in both buckets
- can be cross region (CRR) or same region (SRR)
- can be bucket in other account
- async
- use batch replication to replicate existing ones ( only new obj being replicated)
- cant chain replication

### Use cases
- compliance (CRR)
- latency (CRR)
- replication across accounts (CRR)
- log aggregation (SRR)
- sync data to test account from prod (SRR)

## Performance
- 100-200ms
- 3,5k put copy post delte per prefix
- 5,5k read per prefix
- use multi part upload for parallell upload ( should use when > 100mb, must when 5gb)
- transfer accelerator to upload to edge location instead of directly to s3, also use for multi part upload
- byte range fetches -> multi part download ( parralel download), 

## Select
- filter data server side to reduce network cost (100 lines out of 1 mil lines csv)

## Batch operations
- modify all metadata and properies
- copy objects between buckets
- encrypt all unencrypted objects
- modify acl and tags
- restore objects from glacier
- invoke lambda for each object
- use s3 select to filter then batch
- file + operation + parameter => process
#### S3 inventory: get the list of file
[[Athena]]: filter file

## Storage lens
- account level or orgnaization level
- have optimize advise
- free version and paid version
### Storage len vs CloudWatch
- Storage len: account level or orgnaization level, analytic by day, have optimize advise
- CloudWatch: bucket level, analytic real time
#### Storage len vs Inventory vs Analytic
- inventoty: list file
- analytic: access frequent list => should move to another tier or not, not have advise
- storage len: have dashboard, many metrics, have optimize advise

## WORM (write one read many)
#### Vault
- only for glacier flexible retrieval
- Objects insert into vault can not be modified or deleted
- used for compliance
- Can lock the vault policy from future edits ( can not change in the future)
#### Object lock
- same as vault but in object level
- protect one version of object ( versioning must be enabled ) for amount of time
- retention mode: 
	1. compliance: no one can change
	2. goverment: some people can change
- retention period: time to protect
- legal hold: protect independent from period but can change if have permisson

## Server Access Logging
- If [[CloudTrail]] is not enough information you use this
### S3 access point
- split policy
### S3 lambda access point 
- tranform file before send to application

### Features
- including referer
- including turn around time
